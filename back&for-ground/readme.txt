●	There are photos from the two corners closest to the door; the left corner is named kitchen corner (kc) and the right corner is named soldering corner (sc). 

●	There are both background (bg) and foreground (fg) photos of both. The background photos are a little different from one another although the battery percentage is the same on them which can change with time in real life, so that is not accurate for all battery levels. 

●	The background photos are better for the soldering corner since there are both images with no warm objects and images with warm cups, computer screens and 3d printer.

●	The foregrounds are people sitting down and standing up

●	The temperature interval was manually set to 14.6-27 degrees.
